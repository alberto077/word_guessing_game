Word Guessing Game c++

This is a word-guessing game inspired by Wordle, implemented in C++. 
Players attempt to guess a hidden 5-letter word, and after each guess, they receive feedback on which letters are correct.
 
Features 
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that only valid 5-letter words are accepted.
- **Color-coded Feedback**: 
  -  **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
  - **Grey**: Incorrect letter.
- **Dynamic Game Loop/ Multi-Player**: Players have a limited number of guesses to find the correct word and will be asked if they want to play again after everyones turn is up.

Future Improvements
- Add multiple difficulty levels with varying word lengths.
- Allow for different modes such as customizable word lists to challenge the player you play against.
- Add a graphical interface using a library.
